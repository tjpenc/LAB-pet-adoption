What I learned this lesson: A whole whole lot

1.) querySelector and querySelectorAll
      querySelectorAll takes a .forEach method to iterate through

2.) manipulating DOM - looping through array and actively putting properties of objects into DOM. Add onto the string with +=

3.) event listeners, click and keypressed

4.) Learned some array methods - .filter

5.) Learned .reset method
